>__space is an intresting and fascinating thing in todays world:heart_eyes:..who refuses to explore what is in space?:scream:..no one right!
>space and its stuff are the most coolest and curious things foe evryone..__
>>**curiosity has its own reason for existence.:relaxed:.!**
<p> This is a fictional landing page specially made to register for a virtual event </p> The event is launch of falcon 9 spacecraft by "SPACEX"in the observation of ELON MUSK,
CEO OF SPACEX </P> As i said previously,even i am curious and intrested in astronomy,and interstellar concepts which motivated me to take it as the theme of my ui design.</p> 
we have seen many movies,like interstellar in which earth is destroying and it is nolonger a place to live..and people start exploring space to find a dwelling place like earth
to live on..in the same way..we also have to explore the space.The coming generation will work on spacecrafts a lot..so space exploration technologies is going to have surely
a high demamd in future.That is all about my theme,motivation and future scope of my ui design.
